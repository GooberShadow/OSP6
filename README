I completed the project.

To get the project to execute type make to compile

Then type ./oss to run it

The default run will run the LRU but if you would like to run FIFO you need to type ./oss FIFO

You may also type ./oss LRU to run the LRU or simply leave it to the default

I decided to leave info printing to the terminal, however BE SURE TO CHECK THE LOGFILE AS WELL AS IT CONTAINS WHAT IS REQUIRED

I hope you enjoy my project.
